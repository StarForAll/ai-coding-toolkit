name: workflow-repair
description: Apply safe source-workflow fixes from a `WORKFLOW_QUESTIONS.md` report. Use when re-checking an embedded Trellis temp project report, consulting prior workflow issue history, and repairing `docs/workflows/新项目开发工作流/`.
compatibility: Requires `trellis` on PATH, access to the temp project report plus the workflow source repo, ability to run `task.py create` and `task.py start`, and inline CLI execution with local filesystem access. Repair itself remains main-session inline, but it accepts validated reports produced by either inline `workflow-scan` runs or explicit `workflow-scan --agent` runs.

# workflow-repair

## Version History

- **v2.3**: Clarified that repair-side intake is execution-mode agnostic and
  depends only on the validated `WORKFLOW_QUESTIONS.md` contract, whether the
  scan ran inline or with explicit `--agent` assistance
- **v2.2**: Clarified that successful `workflow-scan` output must already pass
  scan-side read-back validation and that repair-side intake stops when the
  shared report contract is still incomplete
- **v2.1**: Added mandatory repair-task bootstrap, `tmp/workflow-issues/` history documents, all-history replay on every run, strict-review completion rules without mandatory re-embed, and expanded write-scope rules for task and issue-history artifacts
- **v2.0**: Aligned intake with temp-project-only scan reports; removed source-project-root matching and source-location requirements from the shared report contract
- **v1.4**: Added recurrence-closure, contract-surface coverage, and anti-regression gates to reduce repeated repairs and leftover issues
- **v1.3**: Aligned frontmatter with the latest public skill spec by making the description explicitly cover both purpose and trigger, and by adding compatibility requirements
- **v1.2**: Replaced misleading fixed example paths and task-directory placeholders with runtime-sensitive placeholders
- **v1.1**: Clarified temp-project-first verification, explicit repair authorization, no-agent execution, and same-pattern variant handling
- **v1.0**: Initial release

## Purpose

Consume a `WORKFLOW_QUESTIONS.md` report produced by `workflow-scan`, verify
each finding against the temp project and the source project, and apply safe
repairs to workflow source files — ONLY within
`docs/workflows/新项目开发工作流/`.

This skill is the **consumer/fixer** half of the `workflow-scan` /
`workflow-repair` coupled pair.

Its target of judgment is still the embedded workflow result in
`/tmp/trellis-{VERSION}-2`; the source repository is the repair location, not
the primary truth source for whether a reported issue exists.

This skill does **not** require a fresh re-embed as part of the same run. It
must instead use strict source-side review, repeat-trigger checks, variant
sweeps, and history-aware closure to reduce the chance of introducing new
problems.

## When to Use

Use this skill when any of the following is true:

- a `WORKFLOW_QUESTIONS.md` report exists in the temp project and needs to be
  consumed
- the user wants to analyze `/tmp/trellis-{VERSION}-2` and fix the source
  workflow based on real confirmed problems
- the user asks to "repair workflow issues" or "fix workflow findings"
- the user asks to "apply workflow corrections" or "run workflow-repair"
- the same class of workflow issue has already reappeared after one or more
  earlier repair attempts
- a workflow-scan cycle has completed and the repair phase should begin

## When Not to Use

- you need to scan for issues first: use `workflow-scan` in the temp project
- you need a comprehensive audit with version gates and runtime validation: use
  `workflow-audit`
- you need version-drift analysis: use `workflow-capability-audit`
- you are doing a normal implementation task without workflow repair

## Core Rules

1. **Fix scope**: ONLY modify files within
   `docs/workflows/新项目开发工作流/`, the current repair task directory, and
   `tmp/workflow-issues/`. No other directories.
2. **Main CLI only**: do not use agents, sub-agents, or task orchestration to
   perform the repair. Work directly in the current CLI session.
3. **Temp-project-first verification**: the report and the temp project are the
   primary behavior evidence. The source repo explains and repairs the issue,
   but does not by itself prove the issue exists.
4. **Do no harm**: must not introduce new problems when fixing. Every proposed
   change must include side-effect analysis and strict source-side review.
5. **Explicit repair language counts as authorization**: if the current user
   instruction already says to fix real confirmed issues, that instruction
   counts as permission after the correction plan is echoed. If the user only
   asked for analysis/judgment, stop after the plan.
6. **Reports are evidence, not truth**: re-check every finding. A scan finding
   is a hypothesis, not a confirmed fact.
7. **Dedicated repair task is required**: this skill must always run inside a
   dedicated trellis repair task. If there is no active task, create one and
   continue. If there is already an active task, create a new repair task and
   switch to it instead of reusing the existing task.
8. **Issue-history memory is required**: every run must read all numeric
   history documents under `tmp/workflow-issues/` before deciding whether a
   finding is new, repeated, or part of a previously repaired problem cluster.
9. **Repair artifacts persist**: task files and workflow issue history files
   are NOT deleted after completion; they serve as the permanent audit trail.
10. **Conservative adoption**: only adopt a fix where the repair is clear,
    minimal, and safe. If in doubt, mark as `manual-decision`.
11. **Root-cause closure is required**: do not stop at symptom repair. Every
    adopted or trellis-native fix must explain why the issue survived into the
    temp project and what source-side change closes that path.
12. **Variant sweep is required**: once a finding is confirmed, search only
    within `docs/workflows/新项目开发工作流/` for the same pattern or same
    root-cause class and fix safe siblings together.
13. **Contract-surface closure is required**: if a fix changes a behavior
    contract, path, marker, declaration, or workflow rule, update every
    in-scope source surface that must stay aligned in the same repair batch when
    safe. This can include scripts, docs, metadata declarations, and in-tree
    tests under the workflow directory.
14. **Repeated-findings escalation**: if a current finding matches a previously
    attempted repair cluster in the repair logs or issue-history documents, do
    not repeat the same narrow patch blindly. Expand the investigation to the
    missed contract surfaces or mark the item `manual-decision`.
15. **Trellis-native routing**: when Origin = `trellis-native`, the fix must
    NOT modify files outside the workflow directory. Design a patch within the
    workflow so the installer can apply it (add patch script to `commands/`,
    update `HELPER_SCRIPTS`, or add overlay/post-install adjustment).
16. **One-pass strict review**: do not require a same-run re-embed of the
    workflow into a fresh temp project as a completion gate. Instead, the skill
    must complete a strict source-side review covering variant sweep,
    contract-surface verification, repeat-trigger checks, history-aware closure,
    and side-effect analysis before claiming success.
17. **Coupled contract**: this skill must consume `WORKFLOW_QUESTIONS.md` in
    the exact format defined in
    `skills/workflow-scan/references/scan-output-template.md`. If the protocol
    version does not match, stop.
18. **Execution-mode agnostic intake**: repair-side validation depends on the
    final `WORKFLOW_QUESTIONS.md` contract only. A report produced by
    `workflow-scan --agent` is acceptable only if the coordinator's final
    output still passes the same shared read-back validation as an inline scan.
19. **No implied repair-side agent mode**: scan-side `--agent` support does
    not extend to `workflow-repair`. Repair remains main-CLI-only unless its
    own contract changes in a separate scoped update.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `report_path` | No | auto-detect | Absolute path to `WORKFLOW_QUESTIONS.md` |
| `temp_project_path` | No | from report | Absolute path to the temp project root |
| `target_focus` | No | empty | Specific WS-NNN IDs to prioritize |

### Report Path Resolution

1. If `report_path` is explicitly provided, use it.
2. Otherwise: run `trellis -v` to get VERSION, construct path
   `/tmp/trellis-{VERSION}-2/WORKFLOW_QUESTIONS.md`.
3. Validate: the file must exist and have `document-type: workflow-questions`
   in frontmatter.
4. If not found: stop as **Blocked / Report Not Found**.

### Repair Authorization Mode

Determine execution mode from the current user request:

- If the user explicitly says to fix, repair, or process real confirmed issues,
  use `authorized-to-repair`.
- If the user asks only to analyze, judge, or produce a plan, use
  `analysis-only`.
- If ambiguous, default to `analysis-only`.

### Issue History Directory

Fixed location: `tmp/workflow-issues/`

- Each repair execution writes exactly one numeric Markdown file there:
  `0001.md`, `0002.md`, `0003.md`, ...
- Every later run must read all numeric Markdown files in that directory before
  verifying findings.

## Output

Three artifacts:

1. **Correction plan**: presented to the user inline (not written to file
   unless the user requests it). Format: see
   `references/correction-plan-template.md`.
2. **Repair log**: written to the current repair task directory. Format: see
   `references/repair-log-template.md`.
3. **Issue history summary**: written to
   `tmp/workflow-issues/{NNNN}.md`. Format: see
   `references/issue-history-template.md`.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Ensure Report Path and Repair Task Context

1. Resolve the report path (see Path Resolution above).
2. Read enough of the report to derive a short topic:
   - prefer `target_focus` when provided
   - otherwise use the first finding title if available
   - otherwise fall back to `workflow-issues`
3. Sanitize the short topic to a compact kebab-style fragment.
4. Check whether an active task already exists.
5. If there is **no** active task:
   - create a new task titled `workflow-repair-<date>-<short-topic>`
   - start that task
6. If there **is** an active task:
   - create a new task titled `workflow-repair-<date>-<short-topic>`
   - switch to the new repair task
   - do **not** reuse the previous task
7. From this point onward, all task-local artifacts belong to the dedicated
   repair task.
8. If task creation or task start fails: stop as
   **Blocked / Repair Task Setup Failed**.

### Step 1: Locate and Validate Report

1. Read `WORKFLOW_QUESTIONS.md` and validate frontmatter:
   - `document-type` must be `workflow-questions`
   - `protocol` must be `workflow-scan-repair-v2`
   - the shared scan-side report keys must still be present:
     `trellis-version`, `workflow-version`, `workflow-schema-version`,
     `scan-timestamp`, `temp-project-root`, `total-findings`, `p0-count`,
     `p1-count`, `p2-count`
   - required report sections must still exist:
     `## Scan Summary`, `## Analysis Summary`, and `### WS-NNN` finding blocks
   - the `total-findings`, `p0-count`, `p1-count`, and `p2-count` values must
     match the actual finding count and per-severity counts in the report body
2. Read version fields:
   - `trellis-version` from report vs `trellis -v` current
   - `workflow-version` from report vs the current source workflow version when
     such a comparison is useful
   - `workflow-schema-version` from report when present
3. Resolve the temp project root:
   - use `temp_project_path` if provided
   - otherwise read `temp-project-root` from the report
   - if neither is available, derive `/tmp/trellis-{VERSION}-2`
4. Determine repair authorization mode (see `Repair Authorization Mode` above).
5. If protocol mismatch: stop as **Blocked / Protocol Version Mismatch**.
6. If the temp project root does not exist or does not match the report
   context: stop as **Blocked / Temp Project Mismatch**.
7. If the shared keys/sections above are missing, treat the report as a
   scan-side contract failure and stop instead of trying to infer the intended
   fields from alternate names such as `generated_at`, `trellis_version`,
   `temp_project_path`, or `total_findings`.
8. Do not reject or special-case the report based on whether the scan was run
   inline or with `--agent`; only the validated document contract matters.

### Step 2: Parse and Classify Findings

1. Extract all findings from the report. Each finding has: WS-NNN ID, Category,
   Severity Estimate, Origin, Evidence Layer, Evidence list, Temp Project
   Location, Description, Suggested Investigation.
2. Group findings by Origin (`trellis-native` vs `workflow-source`).
3. Within each origin group, sort by Severity Estimate (P0 first, then P1,
   then P2).

### Step 3: Load Repair History and Issue Memory

Before verifying findings, inspect all prior issue memory available in the
current project:

1. Read every numeric Markdown file under `tmp/workflow-issues/` if the
   directory exists.
2. If the directory does not exist yet, treat the history set as empty.
3. Check the current repair task directory for earlier workflow-repair logs if
   this run is being resumed.
4. For each current finding, compare against all loaded history docs using:
   - problem title or WS-ID
   - named root-cause class
   - repaired file paths
   - variant sweep scope
   - key marker/path/string evidence
5. Build a recurrence note for each finding:
   - `first-seen`
   - `repeated-after-prior-repair`
   - `no-history-found`
6. If a finding looks repeated after an earlier repair, require a broader
   contract-surface review before marking it `adopted`.

### Step 4: Verify Each Finding Against Temp Project and Source Project

For each finding, re-check against both the temp project and the source
project:

1. Read the `Temp Project Location` artifact (if specified) in the temp
   project.
2. Infer the likely source-side repair surface from the finding's temp-project
   evidence and description.
3. Read the relevant source-project file(s) needed to test that hypothesis.
4. Compare the temp-project behavior/evidence against the source-side
   declaration and the finding evidence.
5. Cross-reference with workflow-local declarations such as
   `workflow_assets.py` when relevant to the suspected repair path.
6. Identify the root-cause class before deciding:
   - stale declaration drift
   - incomplete installer patch
   - partial cross-file update
   - wrong runtime assumption
   - missing cleanup / residual artifact
   - another clearly named root-cause class
7. Assign a verification result:
   - **Confirmed**: the finding is real in the temp project and the source
     workflow contains a clear, safe repair path → mark as `adopted`
   - **False alarm**: the finding is already fixed, was misidentified, or does
     not survive the temp-project/source cross-check → mark as `ignored`
   - **Blocked**: verification cannot proceed due to missing files, ambiguous
     paths, or external constraints → mark as `blocked`
   - **Needs user input**: the finding is real but the fix involves ambiguity,
     risk, or a trade-off → mark as `manual-decision`
   - **Trellis-native**: the issue is in a trellis-installed artifact, not
     workflow source → mark as `trellis-native`
8. Apply the **negative-optimization guardrail**: if a fix would change
   behavior that currently works correctly (even if the code looks wrong),
   prefer `manual-decision` over `adopted`.
9. If the item is a repeated finding and the current fix proposal does not
   explain why the earlier repair missed it, downgrade the item to
   `manual-decision` or `blocked`.

### Step 5: Variant Sweep Inside the Workflow Root

For every finding marked `adopted` or `trellis-native`:

1. Search only within `docs/workflows/新项目开发工作流/` for the same pattern,
   stale reference, script contract, or root-cause class.
2. Bundle same-root-cause variants into the same planned repair when:
   - the fix shape is materially the same
   - the added scope stays inside the workflow directory
   - the side effects remain understandable and low-risk
3. If a similar location might be affected but the root cause is not clearly
   the same, document it in the plan instead of auto-fixing it.
4. Record the sweep result in the correction plan, repair log, and issue
   history summary, even if the result is `none`.

### Step 6: Build Contract-Surface Coverage Map

For every finding marked `adopted` or `trellis-native`:

1. Identify the source surfaces that should stay aligned if this fix is
   correct:
   - source script(s)
   - source markdown/doc references
   - `workflow_assets.py` declarations
   - in-tree tests under `docs/workflows/新项目开发工作流/commands/`
   - other workflow-local metadata or generated-source companions
2. Classify each surface:
   - `must-update`
   - `must-verify-only`
   - `out-of-scope-but-note`
3. If the issue came from a partially updated contract, do not plan a
   single-file fix when other `must-update` surfaces clearly exist.
4. Record the coverage map in the correction plan and later in the repair log.

### Step 7: Build Correction Plan

For each `adopted` or `trellis-native` finding:

1. Design the minimal fix:
   - File: relative path within `docs/workflows/新项目开发工作流/`
   - Before: description of current state
   - After: description of intended state
   - Change Type: add / modify / remove
   - Root Cause Class: the class identified in verification
   - Recurrence Status:
     `first-seen` | `repeated-after-prior-repair` | `no-history-found`
   - Related Variants Covered: the sibling files or patterns fixed together, or
     `none`
   - Contract Surfaces Covered: every `must-update` and `must-verify-only`
     surface, or `none`
2. Verify the fix does not introduce new problems:
   - Check downstream references that depend on the changed content
   - Check other CLI carriers that may be affected
   - Check `workflow_assets.py` consistency
   - Check whether the same stale marker/path/string still exists elsewhere in
     the workflow directory
   - Check whether all similar issues from `tmp/workflow-issues/` that are
     clearly in scope are either fixed together or explicitly listed as
     unresolved
3. Write side-effect analysis: list every downstream reference, CLI surface, or
   script affected and how.
4. For `trellis-native` findings: design a patch that lives within the workflow
   directory (typically a new or modified script in `commands/`) so the
   `install-workflow.py` installer can apply it.
5. For repeated findings: explicitly state why this plan is broader or safer
   than the earlier attempted repair.

For each `ignored` finding: document the reason.

For each `blocked` finding: document the blocker.

For each `manual-decision` finding: write a concrete question with trade-off
explanation.

Format the complete correction plan using
`references/correction-plan-template.md`.

### Step 8: Present Correction Plan and Decide Whether to Execute

1. Display the full correction plan inline.
2. If mode = `authorized-to-repair`, treat the current user instruction as
   standing authorization after the plan is echoed, unless the user explicitly
   limited the run to analysis only.
3. If mode = `analysis-only`, wait for explicit user confirmation. Options:
   - **Accept all**: apply all `adopted` and `trellis-native` fixes
   - **Accept partial**: specify which WS-NNN findings to apply
   - **Reject**: do not apply any changes
   - **Modify**: request adjustments to specific proposed fixes
4. If the user chooses **Modify**: adjust the specified fixes and re-present
   the updated plan before proceeding.

### Step 9: Execute Confirmed Repairs

1. Apply only the fixes the user confirmed.
2. For each fix:
   - Record the before state (key excerpt, not entire file)
   - Apply the change
   - Record the after state
   - Record the root-cause class and recurrence status
   - Record the related variants covered (or `none`)
   - Record the contract surfaces updated and verified
3. Scope enforcement: if a fix would modify a file outside
   `docs/workflows/新项目开发工作流/`, the current repair task directory, or
   `tmp/workflow-issues/`, skip it and record the violation in the repair log.
4. For each applied fix, record it in the per-fix section of the repair log.

### Step 10: Post-Repair Verification

No same-run re-embed is required. Instead, for each applied fix, verify:

1. **Syntax check**: the modified file is syntactically valid (shell/Python
   script parses, markdown is well-formed).
2. **Cross-reference check**: references from the modified file still resolve
   to existing targets.
3. **Workflow-assets consistency**: the change does not contradict declarations
   in `workflow_assets.py` (e.g., `HELPER_SCRIPTS`, `DISTRIBUTED_COMMANDS`,
   `RETIRED_HELPER_SCRIPTS`).
4. **Variant sweep check**: the same-pattern locations that were intentionally
   fixed together now reflect the intended state.
5. **Contract-surface check**: every surface marked `must-update` or
   `must-verify-only` in the plan was actually updated or verified.
6. **Repeat-trigger check**: search the workflow directory for the stale
   marker/path/string/contract symptom that caused the current finding. If the
   same trigger still exists in an in-scope location, mark the fix
   `unverified`.
7. **History-closure check**: compare the applied fixes against the loaded
   `tmp/workflow-issues/` documents and confirm that clearly similar in-scope
   problems were either fixed together or explicitly recorded as unresolved.
8. **Overall**: if all checks pass, mark as `verified`. If any fails, mark as
   `unverified` and record the failure.

If verification fails for a fix:

- Attempt to revert the change to the before state.
- Record the revert in the repair log.
- Mark the fix status as `failed` or `reverted`.

### Step 11: Write Repair Log, Issue History, and Stop

1. Write the repair log using `references/repair-log-template.md`.
2. Save the repair log to the current repair task directory.
3. Ensure `tmp/workflow-issues/` exists.
4. Determine the next numeric issue-history filename:
   - list all numeric stems under `tmp/workflow-issues/`
   - choose `max + 1`
   - write the filename as four-digit zero-padded Markdown:
     `0001.md`, `0002.md`, `0003.md`, ...
5. Write exactly one issue-history document for this repair execution using
   `references/issue-history-template.md`.
6. Echo the summary:
   - report path consumed
   - repair task path
   - total history documents read
   - adopted / ignored / blocked / manual-decision / trellis-native counts
   - succeeded / failed / skipped counts
   - repair log path
   - issue-history path
7. Optional next steps:
   - later re-run `workflow-scan` on a fresh temp project to verify the broader
     workflow behavior
   - or run `workflow-audit` for comprehensive validation
8. Do not delete task files or the issue-history document.

## Decision State Semantics

| State | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `adopted` | Finding confirmed, fix is clear, minimal, and safe | Apply the fix after user confirms the plan |
| `ignored` | Finding is false alarm, already fixed in source, or not actionable | No action needed; document the reason |
| `blocked` | Verification or repair cannot proceed due to external constraint | Report blocker; no fix attempted |
| `manual-decision` | Finding is real but fix involves ambiguity, risk, or trade-off | Present the question to the user; do not auto-adopt |
| `trellis-native` | Issue is in trellis-installed artifact, not workflow source | Design a patch within the workflow so the installer can apply it |

## Error Handling

| Case | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Report not found | Stop as **Blocked / Report Not Found**. Suggest running `workflow-scan` first. |
| Repair task setup failure | Stop as **Blocked / Repair Task Setup Failed**. Do not continue without a dedicated repair task. |
| Protocol version mismatch | Stop as **Blocked / Protocol Version Mismatch**. The report was produced by a different protocol version. |
| Temp project mismatch | Stop as **Blocked / Temp Project Mismatch**. The report and the live temp project do not line up. |
| Repeated finding with no broader safe fix | Stop as **Blocked / Repeated Finding Needs Broader Closure**. Do not repeat a previously narrow patch without a stronger closure plan. |
| Issue-history write failure | Stop as **Blocked / Issue History Write Failed**. The run must not finish without recording the new issue-history document. |
| No findings in report | Write the repair log and an issue-history document with `total-attempted: 0` and all counts at 0. |
| Fix scope violation | Skip the fix, record the violation in the repair log. Do not modify files outside the allowed three locations. |
| Post-repair verification failure | Revert the change, record the failure and revert in the repair log. |
| User rejects all | Write the repair log and an issue-history document with all findings as `skipped`. No workflow source files modified. |
